# Credit_Card_Validation
Validate credit card number and categorize by brand

Uses Luhn's algorithm to check if credit card number is valid.
This program can categorize the number into Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. 
If the credit card number checks with Luhn's algoritm but does not fall into one of these categories, it will output "Invalid or other brand". 
Otherwise, it will tell the user that it is an "Invalid Card".
